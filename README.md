#Minecraft 3D  Game Engine

This project is a demo which renders a 3D voxel terrain to simulate different noise algorithms. Noise algorithms are implemented using FastNoise2 and then rendered using OpenGL. This demo is fully built in C++. Greedy meshing algorithm implmentation was used to speed up mesh generation and decrease vertex data size.
